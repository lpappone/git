Git ???? Release Notes
======================

Updates since v2.3
------------------

Ports


UI, Workflows & Features

 * The command usage info strings given by "git cmd -h" and in
   documentation have been tweaked for consistency.

 * The "sync" subcommand of "git p4" now allows users to exclude
   subdirectories like its "clone" subcommand does.

 * "git log --invert-grep --grep=WIP" will show only commits that do
   not have the string "WIP" in their messages.

 * "git push" has been taught a "--atomic" option that makes push to
   update more than one ref an "all-or-none" affair.

 * Extending the "push to deploy" added in 2.3, the behaviour of "git
   push" when updating the branch that is checked out can now be
   tweaked by push-to-checkout hook.


Performance, Internal Implementation, Development Support etc.

 * Implementation of N_() macro has been updated slightly to help us
   detect mistakes.

 * Implementation of "reflog expire" has been restructured to fit the
   reflogs better with the recently updated ref API.


Also contains various documentation updates and code clean-ups.


Fixes since v2.3
----------------

Unless otherwise noted, all the fixes since v2.3 in the maintenance
track are contained in this release (see the maintenance releases'
notes for details).

 * "git blame HEAD -- missing" failed to correctly say "HEAD" when it
   tried to say "No such path 'missing' in HEAD".
   (merge a46442f jk/blame-commit-label later to maint).

 * "git rerere" (invoked internally from many mergy operations) did
   not correctly signal errors when told to update the working tree
   files and failed to do so for whatever reason.
   (merge 89ea903 jn/rerere-fail-on-auto-update-failure later to maint).

 * Setting diff.submodule to 'log' made "git format-patch" produce
   broken patches.
   (merge 339de50 dk/format-patch-ignore-diff-submodule later to maint).

 * After attempting and failing a password-less authentication
   (e.g. kerberos), libcURL refuses to fall back to password based
   Basic authentication without a bit of help/encouragement.
   (merge 4dbe664 bc/http-fallback-to-password-after-krb-fails later to maint).
